# Practice Project Using Gymnasium

This repository contains a practice project built using [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/), a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with Gymnasium and reinforce foundational concepts in reinforcement learning.

## Project Overview

This project explores:

- Environment interaction using Gymnasium
- Implementing a basic RL agent
- Experimenting with different environments and configurations

## Features

- Uses Gymnasium's prebuilt environments for quick prototyping
- Implements a simple agent to interact with an environment
- Modular code structure for easy experimentation and scalability

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `gymnasium` library installed

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the project using:

```bash
python main.py
```

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different environments provided by Gymnasium.
